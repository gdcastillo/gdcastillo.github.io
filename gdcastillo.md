<h3>Hello!</h3> My name is Giovanny Castillo.
 
 I'm in the EST zone. I'm using the Windows 10 Home OS. I'm a 22-year old undergraduate from The University of Florida studying computer science and information systems. I'm heavily involved in SHPE, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. On my free time, I play video games with friends and volunteering at local outreach events that revolve around getting children excited about STEM. I was born in [Ecuador](http://wikitravel.org/en/Ecuador). I'm a social, friendly guy who cares about the people around me.
